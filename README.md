Welcome to my first web project - a dynamic news feed webpage crafted with love using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! Here's a peek into what makes it tick:

HTML Awesomeness: Dive into the index.html file where the magic begins! A sleek navigation bar (with a cool logo) awaits, ready to guide you through the latest news. Scroll down to find the main content area, eagerly waiting to showcase captivating blog cards.

CSS Wizardry: Behold the style.css file - my playground for styling elements like the navigation bar, blog cards, and search input. Witness the magic of responsive design as the webpage gracefully adapts to any screen size, ensuring a delightful experience for all users.

JavaScript Jedi Skills: Brace yourself for the adventure that is script.js! Watch as news articles are summoned from the depths of the internet using the mighty News API. Behold, as blog cards materialize before your eyes, dynamically generated with each click and search.

Responsive Design Delight: No matter the device - be it a mighty desktop or a humble smartphone - this webpage shines bright like a star. Thanks to responsive design, it adapts effortlessly to provide a seamless experience for all.

README Roadmap: Ah, the humble README.md file - your guide to unlocking the mysteries of this project. Inside, you'll find a treasure trove of insights, guiding you through the project's structure and functionality with ease.
